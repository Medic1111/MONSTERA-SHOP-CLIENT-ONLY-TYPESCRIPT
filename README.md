## THE IDEA

###### Minimal Me

As a minimalist, I can trully appreciate simple and straight-forwardness in just about any utility

While planning on my next project which was set to be an e-commerce, I was very little inspired with the typical...shoes, clothing, material goods in general

What to 'pretend' to sell that would truly inspire me?

###### My Rescue Monstera

The week prior to engaging in this project, I had the pleasure to rescue a suffering monstera and provide it with love and care it much needed

It was love at first sight...and between staring at her and staring at my blank project, the idea came

I would be able to unite a inspiring target, with the minimalist simple approach, to come up with my e-commerce

###### The Goal

The goal was to list the 3 types of monstera plants available widely in the market on a root page

Such page would be extremely easy to navigate, uncluttered, and to the point

Easy on the eye and on the brain, a simple click to add to cart

The cart is to open right away after an item is added, encouraging the purchase process

The user would then have the option to close the cart and continue shopping or proceed to check out

Check out is a simple form

Once payment is processed a confirmation modal appears
